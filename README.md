Programmer-keyboard-layout
==========================

Keyboard layout, optimized for programming
Idea is make type much easy. 

+ In good code you dont have hardcoded data. digits are more rarely need then operators. All digits are reverted related shift. Its also make possible to type numbers w/ _ and hex capital letters w/o releasing shift.
+ Most langs are C based and intensively uses {} when [] need not so often. Reverted
+ New langs does not require ; when still uses : and | too far from center of keyboard. : w/o shift, | as shifted :, ; now at place of |

That changes are not touch letters so you still can use qwerty or dvorak layout.
